# iPhone13MiniCoolingCase
This repository contains the mechanical design of the iPhone 13 Mini case with an embedded heatsink for improving phone performance.

## Heatsink Development

### Overview
The project explores various heatsink designs to enhance heat dissipation and optimize phone performance. Key considerations include:
- **Thermal dissipation target**: 5W
- **Model limitations**: The CPU is not the sole heating element.
- **Design diversity**: Aesthetic and performance-focused variations.
