# iPhone12MiniCoolingCase
This repository contains mechanical design of the iPhone 12 / 13 mini case with embedded heatsink for improving phone performance



# Heatsink development

Thoughts:
- 5W 
- not perfect model - CPU is not the only heating element
- different designs of the heatsink - both in terms of performance and look

Study 1 Bare iPhone thermal performance

Study 2 Simple 4mm thick heatsink made of circles

Study 3 Squares instead of circles

Study 4 triangles - pyramids

Study 5 lines - air channels

Study 6 air channels in circle - big thick element in most heat generative spot

Study 7 squares, but with thicker elements conducting heat away from heatspots

Study 8 increased surface area

Study 9 2mm thick

Study 10 4 mm thick squares on top, air channels on bottom

Study 11 simulation with slight airflow

Study 12 circles on both sides 4mm thick

Study 13 circles 2 mm thick

Study 14 5 mm diameter circles 3 mm thick

Study 15 circles, air channels along long edge

Study 16 solid element along long edge

Study 17 circles semi solid element in center - lack of holes on the bottom

Study 18 circles and solid element only just above heatspot

Study 19 make solid element even bigger, but leving pattern

Study 20 simulation of heatsink after designing whole case
